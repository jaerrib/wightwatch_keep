        <h2>What it is</h2>
        <p><b>Wightwatch Keep</b> is exactly what it says at the top: an open-source 2D platformer. I started out being
            inspired by the Castlevania games I loved in my youth, but as a first project, I needed reign in my goals.
            What I ended up with is a game with single-screen levels where the goal is to get the key to make the exit
            appear. I planned to have a "tower" consisting of 25 levels divided up into 5 "zones", and the 26th floor
            has a boss with two forms.</p>
        <p>Some of the things I learned how to do include: player control (movement, jumping, climbing, attacking),
            enemies with different attack patterns, handling weapon collision shapes when the sprite is flipped,
            triggers for making certain items appear and be interactive, signals, object makers, and much more. (12-year
            old me would be proud!) </p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Back in the late 80s, I learned to program in BASIC and made some games which were not necessarily good. I
            never pursued programming as a career for reasons too involved to explain here. Fast forward until COVID and
            I saw myself reassessing what I wanted out of life. I delved back into programming with Python and attended
            a coding boot camp to learn web development. That was cool, but I wanted to do something else as well. In
            early 2025, I bought Udemy course to learn how to build games in Godot. <i>This</i> tapped into the joy I
            experienced as a kid! Several tutorials later, I wanted to make something of my own. <b>Wightwatch Keep</b>
            is that game. Enjoy!</p>
