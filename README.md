## Overview

Wightwatch Keep is a puzzle platformer inspired by NES-era games like Castlevania and Adventures of Lolo as well as older style visuals.  It is the first full game I built on my own with Godot.

## Controls:

**Keyboard (Gamepad using XBox buttons for reference)**

- WASD, arrow keys, D-pad or left joystick - move/climb
- Space (A) - jump
- Enter (X) - attack
- P (Start) - pause
- Esc (Select) - quits back to the title screen during the game
